# ai-form-helper

`ai-form-helper` is a JavaScript module that enhances input fields on a webpage by dynamically creating and populating datalists based on the input field's label, placeholder, or other identifying text. It uses jQuery for DOM manipulation and OpenAI's API for generating suggestions.

## Features

- Automatically creates datalists for text, email, telephone, and URL input fields.
- Populates datalists with suggestions generated by OpenAI based on the input field's label or placeholder text.
- Supports various methods to identify input fields, including `label`, `placeholder`, `aria-label`, and `name` attributes.

## Installation

This project uses webpack-user-script to generate a user script that can be installed in your browser. To build the user script, create the required .gitignore'd files and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist/ai-form-helper.user.js` file that you can install in your browser using a user script manager like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey.
